This IR demodulator from Vishay is a great general-purpose receiver for IR-based remote-control projects. It is optimized for data rates up to 4000 bits/s and bursts as short as six cycles, and the detectors epoxy package serves as an infrared filter that helps eliminate noise from visible light sources. The operating voltage range is broad enough for 5 V and 3.3 V logic, and unlike some receiver modules, the TSOP34156 allows for continuous reception. The modules output signal can be directly connected to a microcontroller; no additional external components are required.
